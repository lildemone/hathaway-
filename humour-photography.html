            <h2>Humour Photography</h2>
            <p>
                Humour photography is a genre that captures funny, amusing, or light-hearted moments. It often involves clever compositions, unexpected juxtapositions, and a playful approach to subjects.
                 This type of photography can include candid shots of people in humorous situations, staged setups with props, or even animals caught in funny poses. The goal is to evoke laughter and joy through visual storytelling.
                  Whether it's a well-timed snapshot or a carefully planned scene, humour photography brings a smile to the viewer's face and showcases the lighter side of life.
